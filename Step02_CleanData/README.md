# Step 02: Clean Gait Data by Removing NaN Rows

This step ensures the integrity of the gait data by removing any rows with missing values (`NaN`) from each trial. Cleaning the data at this early stage is critical for accurate segmentation, normalization, and downstream computation of CRP and PCI.

## üîç Objective

To clean each trial dataset by:
- Iterating through all subject-trial combinations
- Identifying and removing any rows that contain missing values
- Returning a clean version of the dataset for further processing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Steps

1. Validate that the data structure `df_list` (from Step 01) exists.
2. Iterate over each file and each trial within the `df_list` cell array.
3. For each non-empty table:
   - Convert the table to a numeric array (if needed)
   - Remove any rows that contain `NaN` values
4. Store cleaned data in a new variable `df_drop_nan`.

## ‚úÖ Key Concepts and Functions

- `isnan()`: Checks for missing values
- `any(..., 2)`: Detects if any value in a row is `NaN`
- `table2array()`: Converts table to numeric array for processing
- `cell`: Data is stored in a 2D cell array by subject √ó trial
- `assignin('base', ...)`: Stores the cleaned result in the MATLAB base workspace

## üí° Why This Step Is Important

- Ensures that no invalid or partial data skews results
- Prevents errors during signal filtering, gait cycle detection, and phase angle computation
- Makes the analysis reproducible and robust, especially for batch processing

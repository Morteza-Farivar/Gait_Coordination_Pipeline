# Step 05: Normalize, Center, and Filter Gait Cycles

This step extracts individual gait cycles from the continuous motion capture data based on detected gait events, centers them around the mean, normalizes them to a standard length (100 points), and applies a simple moving average filter. These normalized cycles are required for accurate computation of phase angles and CRP.

## üîç Objective

To prepare gait cycles from raw kinematic data by:
1. Segmenting the data using heel/toe strike events
2. Centering each cycle to remove DC offset
3. Interpolating each cycle to 100 data points
4. Applying a moving average filter for smoothing

## ‚öôÔ∏è Processing Steps

1. **Validate input**:
   - Ensure `df_drop_nan`, `Lheel_strikes_all`, and `Rheel_strikes_all` (or `toe_strikes_all` for BW) are defined

2. **Iterate over each subject and trial**

3. **For each gait cycle**:
   - Define start and end frames (e.g., from one left heel strike to the next)
   - Extract the segment of interest
   - Center the data by subtracting the mean
   - Interpolate the cycle to 100 points using `interp1`
   - Apply a moving average filter (`window size = 5`)

4. **Store results** in:
   - `centered_cycles_all`
   - `normalized_cycles_all`

## ‚úÖ Key Concepts and Functions

- `interp1()` for linear resampling
- `mean(..., 'omitnan')` for DC offset removal
- `conv(..., 'same')` for moving average filtering
- Uses subject-wise and trial-wise loops
- Handles left-side events as reference for segmentation

## üß™ Code Snippet (demonstration)

```matlab
% Extract cycle
current_cycle = trial_data(start_idx:end_idx, :);
centered_cycle = current_cycle - mean(current_cycle, 1, 'omitnan');

% Normalize to 100 points
x_old = linspace(0, 1, size(centered_cycle, 1));
x_new = linspace(0, 1, 100);
normalized_cycle = zeros(100, size(centered_cycle, 2));
for col_idx = 1:size(centered_cycle, 2)
    normalized_cycle(:, col_idx) = interp1(x_old, centered_cycle(:, col_idx), x_new);
end

% Apply moving average filter
window_size = 5;
filtered_cycle = conv(normalized_cycle(:, col_idx), ones(window_size, 1)/window_size, 'same');
